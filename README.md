## Forward
<span style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;">A</span>ll of us have bad times, only few of us tackle with composure. We have been taught since early childhood, but those knowledge are stale and stinky and of little use. 

All of us have sad times, only few of us handle with decorum. We have made friends since early
childhood, but those faces are withered and wrinkle and of little help. 

Life is compared to many stages, and so does [MERN](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack). 
Our development starts on backend, once it's workable, we proceed to frontend. And then to the backend 
for authentication, then back to the frontend again. To put it simple, we jump between backend and frontend until 
finished. 


## I. Backend


## II. Frontend


## III. Summary 
Things get started small and tidy, but mess up unconceivably fast. A formidable monster of monolith ends up, usually.

Man, however wise and nice, tends to be too confident in one's potency, but neglect obstacles lay ahead.
